# weather_app
This is a weather app with simple UI/UX, including forms to GET/POST weather data
using API keys from www.openweathermap.org.  The code is written in python and parses
data from .json files.  This application gets weather and searches for weather updates
in real time.  It configs two API keys, pulling and translating .json data detailing
both celsius and farenheight.
